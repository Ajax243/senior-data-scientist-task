# Part 3 — Model Design & Data Sufficiency

Overview
- The notebook `part3.ipynb` documents why the current data is insufficient for robust ML, the gaps to resolve, and a phased plan to get to production models.

Highlights
- Current Data Inventory: campaigns, campaign_leads, campaign_metrics, lead_status_changes, insights.
- Gaps: missing creative/targeting/context features, limited history, lead enrichment absent, quality issues.
- Use Cases: lead scoring, campaign forecasting, budget optimization — with required additional data per use case.
- Roadmap: Immediate wins (instrumentation), short-term enrichments (CRM + audience metadata), long-term (historical depth + attribution).

How to View
- Open `part3/part3.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter to read the full write-up (markdown-heavy).
